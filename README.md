Public Projects & Ideas Repository
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This GitHub account serves as my public workspace where I openly publish:

- Completed and ongoing IT projects

- System ideas, concepts, and architectural designs

- Prototypes and experimental implementations

All repositories are shared for public use, learning, reference, and knowledge sharing. Some repositories may represent early-stage ideas or proofs of concept, published intentionally to document thinking processes and encourage further exploration.
